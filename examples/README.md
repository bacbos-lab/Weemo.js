## WeemoDriver integration sample files

You can find here some samples to how-to make calls with WeemoDriver 4.x

- <a href="https://github.com/weemo/Release-4.x/blob/WeemoDriver/examples/tiny_sample.html">timy_sample.html</a>: This file was created to support our <a href="https://github.com/weemo/Release-4.x/wiki/Javascript-API---Quick-start">Quick Start tutorial</a>. It connects you as <font color="#995555">"user_id"</font> UID and launches a call as a host of a conference.<br>

- 1 to 1 Call: In this folder you will find two files, first one for the caller, the second one for callee.<br/>
- Call Multy-party: Contains 1 hmlt file to connect the host of the conference and two other files to connect attendees. <br/>

All those files must be edited with yours:

- <font color="#995555">APP_ID</font>: Application Identifier (API key) provided by Weemo.
- <font color="#995555">YOUR_UID</font>: Unique identifier to identify your session in Weemo Allocation DataBase.
- <font color="#995555">YOUR_DISPLAY_NAME</font>: The Displayname to display to other participant. This information is only informative.
